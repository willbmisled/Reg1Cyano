use these command instead of the knit icon if you want the data and work loaded into the R workspace
  library(knitr)
    setwd("Access")
    knit('cyanoMonDocumentation.rmd')
  -->
```{r setup, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE} 
  #########function to install (if needed) and load R packages by list
libs<-c("knitr") #list of packages to load

installLoad<-function(pck){ #user defined function
    if(!pck%in%installed.packages()){install.packages(pck)}
    require(pck, character.only = TRUE)
  }
lapply(libs,function(x) installLoad(x))  #Load/Install require packages
```

To Do List
-------------------------

* Build forms
* Complete 2014 data QA/QC
* Interface for Phone App
* Update for 2015

Considerations for 2015 database
-------------------------
* Remove Field "analysisTime" from table tblAnalysis
* Remove Field "rep" from table tblFluorometry 
* Combine tables tblAnalysis & tblFluorometry
* Do we want to include anytime of replicate analyses or readings?
* Add text field 'stationDescription' to describe location of the station (e.g., off Bubby's dock)
* JSON to google docs link
* use phone app for field data only?
* add tables for lab results and ancillary data-toxins, nutrients, secchi, etc.

Background
-------------------------

* EPA region 1 is coordinating a Cyanobacteria Monitoring Progam for the six New England States (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, & VT)
* Data collection initiated during the summer of 2014
* 2014 data have been collated and standardized
* For future data collection we need a relational database developed for data entry and archiving 
* The Database needs to work with a Data Collection Phone App under development
* For now, the database will be created in MSAccess (cyanoMon.mdb)

Database Structure
-------------------------

* The five tables in the access database (cyanoMon.mdb) are described below:

![Relationships for cyanoMon.mdb](cyanoMonRelationships.jpg)

* **tblWaterbody** provides general information on the waterbody and assigns a unique identifier.  Ideally we will have this table populated before the field crews go out so that they can select the correct lake from a list.  The reality is that we will also need to be able to add lakes on the fly as new lakes are added to the sampling plan. There may be multiple stations for each waterbody.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**waterbodyID**|Short Text|Primary Key for this table. Unique ID for the Waterbody.  Can either be entered by the users or will be added later.
**waterbodyName**|Short Text|Name of the waterbody
**state**|Short Text|Combo Box ("CT"; "MA"; "ME"; "NH"; "RI"; "VT"): Two letter state abbreviations
**town**|Short Text|Text Box: Closest town to the lake
**WBID**|Long Integer|Text Box: EPA Waterbody Identifier
**otherWaterbodyID**|Short Text|Text Box: If the states or the samping organization have a unique identifier for the waterbody it can be added here.
**longitudeWB**|Double|Text Box: longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the lake centroid.  This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**latitudeWB**|Double|Text Box: latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the lake centroid. This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**locationSourceWB**|Short Text|Combo Box ("WaterbodyDatabase"; "GPS"; "GoogleEarth"; "BingMaps"; "topoMap"): How was the location determined? This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**commentWB**|Long Text| Text Box: Additional information or comments

* **tblStation** within each Waterbody there may be multiple stations. This table provides general information on the station.  There may be multiple samples taken from each station.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**stationID**|Short Text|Primary Key for this table. Unique ID for the Station
**waterbodyID**|Short Text|Lookup primary Key from tblWaterbody
**otherStationID**|Short Text|Text Box: If the states or the samping organization have a unique identifier for the station it can be added here.
**stationType**|Short Text|List Box/Radio Button ("nearShore"; "offShore";"other"): Location of the station in relation to the shore;for special situations choose other and add notes in field "commentStation"
**longitudeSta**|Double|Text Box: longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the station.  Miniumum of 4 decimal places; 6 decimal places prefered.
**latitudeSta**|Double|Text Box: latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the station.  Miniumum of 4 decimal places; 6 decimal places prefered.
**locationSourceSta**|Short Text|Combo Box ("WaterbodyDatabase"; "GPS"; "GoogleEarth"; "BingMaps"; "topoMap"): How was the location determined?
**commentStation**|Long Text| Text Box: Additional information or comments

**sampleMethod**|Short Text|Combo Box ("Integrated Sampler"): should be Integrated Sampler but other values can be added.
