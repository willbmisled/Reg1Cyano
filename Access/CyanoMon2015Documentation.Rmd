Readme
-------------------------

This document is available here: https://github.com/willbmisled/Reg1Cyano/blob/master/Access/cyanoMon2015Documentation.md

To Do List
-------------------------

* Build forms-with data validation steps
* Interface for Phone App
    - Make sure ID structure is the same between database and phoneApp
* Remove field "organization" from tblSample.  This is now in tblOrganization

Question
-------------------------
* Do we remove the field "filtered"?
* Should we add table for lab results and ancillary data-toxins, nutrients, secchi, etc.?
* How do we keep track of what method was used to enter the data?
* Do we want to keep track of which Fluorometers are used (i.e, assign each unit a code)?
* Do we need to capture information on primary and secondary standards?
* How can we capture and archive the photos?
* Who owns the data? Where will it be stored? Are there access restrictions?


Changes for the 2015 database
-------------------------
**tblWaterbody**

* removed field "otherWaterbodyID"
* changed commentWB to format "Long Text" to allow for multiple comments

**tblStation**

* removed field "otherStationID"
* changed commentSta to format "Long Text" to allow for multiple comments
* renamed "stationLocation" to "stationDescription" to match phoneApp

**tblSample**

* added field "sampleRep" to register replicate samples: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate" 

**tblFluorometry** 

* table removed and fields added to tblAnalysis

**tblAnalysis**

* added fields from tblFluorometry
    - "parameter"
    - "fluorometerType"
    - "rep" renamed "analysisRep": with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
    - "reading" renamed "valueUGL"
* fields that were not transferred from from tblFluorometry
    - fluorometryID
    - commentFluorometry
    - units

Background
-------------------------

* EPA region 1 is coordinating a Cyanobacteria Monitoring Progam for the six New England States (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, & VT)
* Data collection initiated during the summer of 2014
* 2014 data have been collated and standardized
* For future data collection we need a relational database developed for data entry and archiving 
* The Database needs to work with a Data Collection Phone App under development
* The database will be created in MSAccess (cyanoMon2015.mdb)


Database Structure
-------------------------

* The relationships between the tables are shown in the figure below

![Relationships for cyanoMon2015.mdb](cyanoMon2015Relationships.jpg)

* Each table in the access database (cyanoMon2015.mdb) is described and data
definitions are given below

**tblOrganization** provides contact information for each organization contributing to the monitoring.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**orgID**|Short Text|combo Box(AED, CRWA, CTDEEP, MEDEP, NHDES, RIWW, UNH, VTDEC). Primary Key for this table. Unique ID for the Organization. Acronym for orgName 
**orgName**|Short Text|Combo Box ("EPA Atlantic Ecology Division", "Charles River Watershed Association", "CT Department  of Environmental Protection", "ME Department of Environmental Protection", "NH Department of Environmental Services", "RI Watershed Watch", "University of NH Center for Freshawater Biology", "VT Department of Environmental Conservation")
**contact**|Short Text|Name of the person in charge of data steward for the organization. Who can be contacted with questions about the data?
**email**|Short Text|Email address of contact person (data steward).
**phone**|Short Text|Phone number (xxx-xxx-xxxx) of contact person (data steward).

**tblWaterbody** provides general information on the waterbody and assigns a unique identifier.  Ideally we will have this table populated before the field crews go out so that they can select the correct lake from a list.  The reality is that we will also need to be able to add lakes on the fly as new lakes are added to the sampling plan. There may be multiple stations for each waterbody.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**waterbodyID2014**|Short Text|In some cases the waterbodyID was changed between 2014 and 2015.  If they are different the 2014 ID is listed in this table.  This field will not be included in data entry forms.
**waterbodyID**|Short Text|Primary Key for this table. Unique ID for the Waterbody. Can either be entered by the users or or assigned by the phoneApp.
**orgID**|Short Text|Lookup primary Key from tblOrganization
**waterbodyName**|Short Text|Name of the waterbody
**state**|Short Text|Combo Box ("CT"; "MA"; "ME"; "NH"; "RI"; "VT"): Two letter state abbreviations
**town**|Short Text|Text Box: Closest town to the lake
**WBID**|Long Integer|Text Box: EPA Waterbody Identifier; Not in phoneApp.  This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**longitudeWB**|Double|Text Box: longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the lake centroid.  This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**latitudeWB**|Double|Text Box: latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the lake centroid. This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**locationSourceWB**|Short Text|Combo Box ("WaterbodyDatabase"; "GPS"; "GoogleEarth"; "BingMaps"; "topoMap"): How was the location determined? This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**commentWB**|Long Text| Text Box: Additional information or comments

**tblStation** within each Waterbody there may be multiple stations. This table provides general information on the station.  There may be multiple samples taken from each station. Note: this table was first made from tblStation in Data2014.mdb.  A query (qryMaketblStation2015) the table (temp_tblStation2015).  This table is essentially the same except that the field "stationLocation" was renamed "stationDescription" if "stationLocation" was blank the field "otherStationID" was substituted.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**stationID2014**|Short Text|In some cases the stationID was changed between 2014 and 2015.  If they are different the 2014 ID is listed in this table.  This field will not be included in data entry forms.
