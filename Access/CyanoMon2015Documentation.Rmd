Readme
-------------------------

This document is available here: https://github.com/willbmisled/Reg1Cyano/blob/master/Access/CyanoMonDocumentation.md

To Do List
-------------------------

* Build forms-with data validation steps
* Interface for Phone App
    - Make sure ID structure is the same between database and phoneApp

Question
-------------------------
* Do we remove the field "filtered"?
* Should we add table for lab results and ancillary data-toxins, nutrients, secchi, etc.?
* How do we keep track of what method was used to enter the data?
* Do we want to keep track of which Fluorometers are used (i.e, assign each unit a code)?
* Do we need to capture information on primary and secondary standards?
* How can we capture and archive the photos?


Changes for the 2015 database
-------------------------
**tblWaterbody**

* removed field "otherWaterbodyID"
* changed commentWB to format "Long Text" to allow for multiple comments

**tblStation**

* removed field "otherStationID"
* changed commentSta to format "Long Text" to allow for multiple comments
* renamed "stationLocation" to "stationDescription" to match phoneApp

**tblSample**

* added field "sampleRep" to register replicate samples: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate" 

**tblFluorometry** 

* table removed and fields added to tblAnalysis

**tblAnalysis**

* added fields from tblFluorometry
    - "parameter"
    - "fluorometerType"
    - "rep" renamed "analysisRep": with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
    - "reading" renamed "valueUGL"
* fields that were not transferred from from tblFluorometry
    - fluorometryID
    - commentFluorometry
    - units

Phone App
-------------------------
* General Questions and Comments
    - will there be an instruction manual?
    - no indicator of whether table has been saved (updated or not) except on Station Table; could the text color for "Update DB" change depending on update status (red=unsaved items; green=everything up to date)
    - no warning if you leave a page without saving (updating)
    - date and time selector widgets difficult to use.
    - selection button on drop down list very small.
    - yes/no dropdowns have phycocyanin and chl. as choices instead of "yes" & "no"; I see what is happening.  Whenever you choose a dropdown it stays on the screen.  When you go to another dropdown it writes over the first but both values are still visible.
    - dilution dropdown 
    - if you select "update DB" and there are unfilled fields it returns you to the missing field but erases other fields. 
    - temperature fields (sample & analysis) auto adds a decimal place so 21 becomes 2.1
    - How can we capture the email and phone number for data entered by phoneApp?

* Welcome Screen:
    - how are the name, email, phone, & org saved and linked to the data tables?
    - can the app remember this info and reuse it?
    - Organization should be a combo box that allows for new organizations to be added and remembered.
    - "new lake" & "existing lake" button only visible in portrait mode.  This should be fixed or the app could be locked in portrait.
    
* New Lake Screen:
    - Apparently this will be used to both add new waterbodies and select known waterbodies that are already in the app.  Somewhat confusing.
    - on screen keyboard blocks view of data entry boxes.
    - The abbreviation "WBID" (GENERATE WBID button) is a field name in the database.
    - If you start adding data then cancel when you return the data entered are not erased.  
    - can "generate WBID" without adding the lake name or date.
    
* waterbody screen
    - Include NY and Ontario in State should be a combo box-allowing other states beside the known 6.  Ontario and NY should be included also.
    
* station:
    - RI out of range on longitude (-71.4)
    
* sample screen
    - add "today" to sampleDate widget
    - add "now" to sampleTime widget
    - would be nice to be able to choose a station ID directly from this screen instead of having to pass through waterbody & station pages first.  If a person goes to a lake they will likely want to collect samples from more than 1 station at each visit.  
    - Add field "fieldCrew" to tblSample
    - rename field "time" to "sampleTime" in tblSample
    - Add field "sampleRep" to tblSample: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
    
* Analysis Screen:
    - text slightly garbled for "Parameter" drop down
    - Add field "analysisRep" to tblAnalysis: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
        
* submit page
    - should be able to submit more than one lake at a time- perhaps a checklist of lakeIDs with a status indicator showing whether they have been submitted before or not.
    - can submit the same data multiple times-data arrives with the same subject line and the same file names.
    - why are we given so many choices on how to send the data (twitter-facebook-etc)?
    - email address for submissions can be changed.  Is this a good idea?
    - does not send "waterbody" table

Background
-------------------------

* EPA region 1 is coordinating a Cyanobacteria Monitoring Progam for the six New England States (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, & VT)
* Data collection initiated during the summer of 2014
* 2014 data have been collated and standardized
* For future data collection we need a relational database developed for data entry and archiving 
* The Database needs to work with a Data Collection Phone App under development
* The database will be created in MSAccess (cyanoMon2015.mdb)


Database Structure
-------------------------

* The relationships between the tables are shown in the figure below

![Relationships for cyanoMon2015.mdb](cyanoMon2015Relationships.jpg)

* Each table in the access database (cyanoMon2015.mdb) is described and data
definitions are given below

**tblOrganization** provides contact information for each organization contributing to the monitoring.

**tblWaterbody** provides general information on the waterbody and assigns a unique identifier.  Ideally we will have this table populated before the field crews go out so that they can select the correct lake from a list.
