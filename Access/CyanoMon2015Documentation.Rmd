To Do List
-------------------------

* Build forms-with data validation steps
* Interface for Phone App
    - Make sure ID structure is the same between database and phoneApp
* Need new relationships figure

Question
-------------------------
* Do we remove the field "filtered"?
* Should we add table for lab results and ancillary data-toxins, nutrients, secchi, etc.?
* How do we keep track of what method was used to enter the data?
* Do we want to keep track of which Fluorometers are used (i.e, assign each unit a code)?
* Do we need to capture information on primary and secondary standards?


Changes for the 2015 database
-------------------------
**tblWaterbody**
* removed field "otherWaterbodyID"
* changed commentWB to format "Long Text" to allow for multiple comments

**tblStation**
* removed field "otherStationID"
* changed commentSta to format "Long Text" to allow for multiple comments
* renamed "stationLocation" to "stationDescription" to match phoneApp

**tblSample**
* added field "sampleRep" to register replicate samples: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate" 

**tblFluorometry** 
* table removed and fields added to tblAnalysis

**tblAnalysis**
* added fields from tblFluorometry
    - "parameter"
    - "fluorometerType"
    - "rep" renamed "analysisRep": with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
    - "reading" renamed "valueUGL"
* fields that were not transferred from from tblFluorometry
    - fluorometryID
    - commentFluorometry
    - units

Phone App
-------------------------
* Add field "sampleDate" to tblSample
* Add field "organization" to tblSample
* Add field "fieldCrew" to tblSample
* rename field "time" to "sampleTime" in tblSample
* Check formating on field "sampleTime"
* Add field "sampleRep" to tblSample: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
* Add field "analysisRep" to tblAnalysis: with default value "primary" and optional value "duplicate"
* How can we capture the email and phone number for data entered by phoneApp?


Background
-------------------------

* EPA region 1 is coordinating a Cyanobacteria Monitoring Progam for the six New England States (CT, MA, ME, NH, RI, & VT)
* Data collection initiated during the summer of 2014
* 2014 data have been collated and standardized
* For future data collection we need a relational database developed for data entry and archiving 
* The Database needs to work with a Data Collection Phone App under development
* The database will be created in MSAccess (cyanoMon2015.mdb)


Database Structure
-------------------------

* The relationships between the tables are shown in the figure below

![Relationships for cyanoMon2015.mdb](cyanoMon2015Relationships.jpg)

* Each table in the access database (cyanoMon2015.mdb) is described and data definitions are given below

**tblWaterbody** provides general information on the waterbody and assigns a unique identifier.  Ideally we will have this table populated before the field crews go out so that they can select the correct lake from a list.  The reality is that we will also need to be able to add lakes on the fly as new lakes are added to the sampling plan. There may be multiple stations for each waterbody.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**waterbodyID**|Short Text|Primary Key for this table. Unique ID for the Waterbody.  Can either be entered by the users or or assigned by the phoneApp.
**waterbodyName**|Short Text|Name of the waterbody
**state**|Short Text|Combo Box ("CT"; "MA"; "ME"; "NH"; "RI"; "VT"): Two letter state abbreviations
**town**|Short Text|Text Box: Closest town to the lake
**WBID**|Long Integer|Text Box: EPA Waterbody Identifier; Not in phoneApp.  This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**longitudeWB**|Double|Text Box: longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the lake centroid.  This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**latitudeWB**|Double|Text Box: latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the lake centroid. This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**locationSourceWB**|Short Text|Combo Box ("WaterbodyDatabase"; "GPS"; "GoogleEarth"; "BingMaps"; "topoMap"): How was the location determined? This field will be populated by the database administrator.
**commentWB**|Long Text| Text Box: Additional information or comments

**tblStation** within each Waterbody there may be multiple stations. This table provides general information on the station.  There may be multiple samples taken from each station.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
**stationID**|Short Text|Primary Key for this table. Unique ID for the Station
**waterbodyID**|Short Text|Lookup primary Key from tblWaterbody
**stationDescription**|Short Text|Text description of the station location
**stationType**|Short Text|List Box/Radio Button ("nearShore"; "offShore";"other"): Location of the station in relation to the shore;for special situations choose other and add notes in field "commentStation"
**longitudeSta**|Double|Text Box: longitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the station.  Miniumum of 4 decimal places; 6 decimal places prefered.
**latitudeSta**|Double|Text Box: latitude in decimal degrees (WGS84) of the station.  Miniumum of 4 decimal places; 6 decimal places prefered.
**locationSourceSta**|Short Text|Combo Box ("WaterbodyDatabase"; "GPS"; "GoogleEarth"; "BingMaps"; "topoMap"): How was the location determined?
**commentStation**|Long Text| Text Box: Additional information or comments

**tblSample** for each station within a waterbody there may be multiple sample events. This table provides general information on each sample event.  There may be multiple analysis events for each sample event.

Field  | Data Type | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------

**organization**|Short Text|Combo Box ("CRWA"; "CTDEEP"; "MEDEP"; "NHDES";"RIWW"; "UNH_CFB"; "VTDEC"): Name of the organization in charge of visit; if more than one choose the primary
**fieldCrew**|Short Text|Text Box: Names of the field crew separated by commas
**sampleMethod**|Short Text|Combo Box ("Integrated Sampler"): should be Integrated Sampler but other values can be added.
**sampleRep**|Short Text|Option to choose between "primary" (default) and "duplicate". Note: a sample rep should be a completely new sample not just a subsample from the original sample.
